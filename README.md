## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `chessdotcom` Python module (you can install it via `pip install chessdotcom`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script (`chesscom_pgn_downloader.py`) to your computer.
2. Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using the command `python chesscom_pgn_downloader.py`.
4. Enter the Chess.com username when prompted.
5. Choose whether you want each game to be saved in a separate PGN file or all games in a single PGN file.
6. Wait for the script to download and save the games. The files will be saved in a new folder named `<username> - Games` in the same directory as the script.

## Alternatively, you can also use the script on a public replit by following these steps:

1. Go to https://replit.com/@Rain305/Allchesscomgames.
2. Click the "Fork" button
3. Click on the "Run" button or press Ctrl + Enter.
4. Enter the Chess.com username when prompted.
5. Choose whether you want each game to be saved in a separate PGN file or all games in a single PGN file.
6. Wait for the script to download and save the games. The files will be saved in a new folder named <username> - Games in the "Files" section on the left sidebar.
7. Download the Folder or File as a zip  
  
Note: Chess.com allows you to import more than one PGN, however lichess doesn't as far as I know.

I made most of this readme.md with chatgpt ;)
